## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run the code in this repository, you will need:

- [Java 8 or later](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html) installed.
- A Java IDE or text editor (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or Visual Studio Code).
- Command-line access to compile and run Java files if you prefer not to use an IDE.

### Utils package
The `utils` package propose an `Helper` class that provides various functions to help testing the algorithms:
- `Helper.time`:  provide a wrapper to measure the time in ms to estimate the running time of a function.

### How to Clone the Repository

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/algorithms.git
   ```
2.  Navigate into the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd algorithms
    ```

## How to run the codes

1. Compile the code you want to test
    ```bash
    javac -cp FileName.java
    ```
2. Run the compiled code using the following command on the .class file:
    ```bash
    java FileName
    ```
